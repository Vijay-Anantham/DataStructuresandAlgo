## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a diverse set of DSA problems covering topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, dynamic programming, and more. Each problem is accompanied by its solution implemented in a programming language.

The main objectives of this repository are:

- To provide a comprehensive collection of DSA problems for self-study or interview preparation.
- To demonstrate different algorithms and approaches to solving these problems.
- To encourage collaboration and contributions from the community.

Feel free to explore the problems and solutions, analyze the code, and use them as a reference to understand and practice DSA concepts.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── Array
│   ├── Problem1
│   │   ├── problem1_solution.cpp
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── Problem2
│   │   ├── problem2_solution.py
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── ...
├── LinkedList
│   ├── Problem1
│   │   ├── problem1_solution.cpp
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── Problem2
│   │   ├── problem2_solution.py
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── ...
├── Stack

├── Graph
│   ├── ...
├── Sorting
│   ├── ...
├── Searching
│   ├── ...
├── DynamicProgramming
│   ├── ...
└── ...
```

Each data structure category (e.g., Array, LinkedList, Stack, etc.) has its own folder. Within each folder, you will find subfolders named after the specific problem. Each problem folder contains the problem statement (in a README.md file) and the solution file (e.g., problem_solution.cpp, problem_solution.py).

You can navigate through the folders and explore the problems based on the DSA topics you are interested in.

## Contributing
